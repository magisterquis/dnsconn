1. Handshake request - zzzzcccccccccc
        zzzz - Literal zzzz means "first chunk of pubkey, gib CID"
                After that, use the CID
        cccc - As many bytes of chunk as are allowed, used to set expected
                chunklen for the connection
   Response to first request is the CID
   Response to subsequent requests is number of bytes of pubkey received

2. An NN byte buffer is sent to the client containing random bytes
   The client replies with the bytes inverted (i.e. ^=0xff).
        Maybe use a variable number of bytes?
        Maybe have the number of bytes set?
        Maybe hash the bytes to prevent attacks of some sort?

3. Client -> Server messages: iiiiccccccccc
        iiii - CID
        cccc - b32 Chunk, up to a max of chunklen.
        Response - Index (LFSR?) of received chunk

4. Server -> Client messages: iiiiwindex
        iiii - CID
        w - Literal w
        index - Index (LFSR?) of next chunk
        Response - 17.chunk
